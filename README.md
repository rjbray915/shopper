# Quarantine Shopper
My first game. Writing it in SDL. A majority of code so far is what I learned from the Lazy Foo' Productions tutorial on beginner game programming: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php . Currently, I am working on board generation and programming a pathing algorithm for enemies.
